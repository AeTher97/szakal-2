# Tabs
Tabs are the main content of the application. They are what is visible in under the navigation bar. Sources for the tabs 
are available in the folders with corresponding names in the `${PROJECT_ROOT}/frontend/components` directory. 

The easiest way to track down any components in the secure part of the app is to follow component tree down from 
[Secure Navigation Routes](../src/components/navigation/SecureNavigationRoutes.jsx) file.
