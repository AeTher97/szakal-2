# Contributing
All people that would like to contribute to this module should familiarize themselves with all documents in this 
directory.

We should strive to write as clean of the Java as possible to make this project easy to maintain for next ones to come.

Contributors should really add enough tests with every new change, especially the new features. I would strongly 
encourage that to be integration tests as outlined in the [TESTING_STRATEGY](TESTING_STRATEGY.md) document.

All tests should be run before making any pull requests so that we respect each other's time.

When changes are made contributors should double-check with these docs if anythings needs to be updated. Goes especially for
the api-docs and the [DATA](DATA.md) file since it contains the database structure.

Let's make the greatest Szakal we can together!
